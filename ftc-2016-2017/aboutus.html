        <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
        <p>We are <strong>Griffin Robotics</strong>. This is our fourth year as team <strong>7582</strong> in the FIRST Tech Challenge competition.</p>
        <br /><br />
        <h1>The Team:</h1>
        <table id="team-bios" align="center" width="85%" style="table-layout:fixed">

            	<td>
                	<h3>Patrick Duane</h3>
                    <p>My name is Patrick Duane. I am one of the team's student leaders this year. As a senior at nex+Gen Academy, I am required to do a senior project this year. I have made mine leading the FTC team.</p>
                    <p>Besides leading the FTC team, I am active member of both my school and my church. At school, I help my friend lead a music club. At my church, Hoffmantown Church, I am a volunteer in the children's ministry and play with the youth/college group band on Wednesdays and Thursdays. On top of these, I also find myself juggling two college classes: Calculus 1 and C++ Programming 1.</p>
                    <p>As for hobbies, I have a wide variety. I very much enjoy programming, and do an extensive amount in Java, Python and HTML/CSS. In fact, this entire website is designed and build from scratch. I also enjoy the harder aspects of technology. I am working with one of my friends on a room security system that requires both fingrprint and passcode authentication, and will email me pictures of anyone who fails the tests. Alongside this, I am programming a server/client for remote access. Another of my hobbies is playing music, as you probably guessed from my musical activities. I play acoustic guitar and am learning drums. I enjoy archery as well, and am considering some projects that combine my technological interests with the archer side of me.</p>
