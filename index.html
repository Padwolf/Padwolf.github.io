Well, it looks like my software didn't record the audio this week, so I don't have a video to post. We'll try again next week.

            <h4>Campfire Worship, Take 2</h4>
            <p>
                My internet is back and, barring other obstacles, the Campfire
                Worship is back on. It will take place this coming Tuesday, at
                the previously determined time, 7:30 to 8:30 pm. For anyone who
                cannot make that time, the recording should be up within an
                hour after the session ends. Please keep me in your prayers.
                I've been fighting a sinus infection for a while. I'm finally
                on what I need to get over it, but it was messing with my
                ability to hit notes the other day. I believe I will be well
                enough Tuesday, but continued prayer is appreciated. <br />
                I hope you make it Tuesday.
            </p>

            <h4>SD Campfire Worship Postponed</h4>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, I have been experiencing internet issues. It should be fixed soon,
                but I will have to wait until next week to start the campfire worship meetings. <br />
                Please keep this in your prayers
            </p>
