			<h4>Critical Updates!</h4>
			<p>
There have been a couple of key changes regarding my website and campfire worship. <br />
First and most importantly, I forgot that I had set an end date on the campfire worship Zoom event. Because of this, the Zoom link you have been using WILL NOT WORK. I have created a new Zoom meeting event that should not end until I manually stop it. The link for this event will be included at the bottom. <br />
Second, I acquired two domain names for my website that will make remembering its URL much easier. The new addresses are "wolf-song.com" and "campfire-worship.com". The former will take you to the home page of my website, and the latter to the campfire worship page. <br />
Following is a list of important links: <br />
<a href="https://wolf-song.com">wolf-song.com</a> - The home page of my website <br />
<a href="https://campfire-worship.com">campfire-worship.com</a> - The campfire worship page <br />
<a href="https://zoom.campfire-worship.com">zoom.campfire-worship.com</a> - The Zoom link for the meeting <br />
<a href="https://zoom.wolf-song.com">zoom.wolf-song.com</a> - Same as above <br />
<a href="https://youtube.campfire-worship.com">youtube.campfire-worship.com</a> - The YouTube playlist for previous Campfire Worship events <br /> <br />
Inasmuch, you can now reach me via email through patrick@wolf-song.com or patrick@campfire-worship.com <br /> <br />
In the future, please use one of the two Zoom links here to connect to the campfire worship meetings. If anything should happen to this meeting event, the two links here will be updated and continue to work without a hitch. <br />
Thanks, everyone, and see you Tuesday!

Well, it looks like my software didn't record the audio this week, so I don't have a video to post. We'll try again next week.

            <h4>Campfire Worship, Take 2</h4>
            <p>
                My internet is back and, barring other obstacles, the Campfire
                Worship is back on. It will take place this coming Tuesday, at
                the previously determined time, 7:30 to 8:30 pm. For anyone who
                cannot make that time, the recording should be up within an
                hour after the session ends. Please keep me in your prayers.
                I've been fighting a sinus infection for a while. I'm finally
                on what I need to get over it, but it was messing with my
                ability to hit notes the other day. I believe I will be well
                enough Tuesday, but continued prayer is appreciated. <br />
                I hope you make it Tuesday.
            </p>

            <h4>SD Campfire Worship Postponed</h4>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, I have been experiencing internet issues. It should be fixed soon,
                but I will have to wait until next week to start the campfire worship meetings. <br />
                Please keep this in your prayers
            </p>
