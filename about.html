                                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                                <p>As a career path, I am a college student studying Computer Science. Blah blah</p>
                                <p>My life as a hobbyist is a lot more interesting. I have played guitar for around
                                8 years. God has blessed me with the opportunity to be a worship leader both at my
                                church as well as at my college Christian ministry. In recent years, I have found
                                myself with a thirst for knowledge that has led me down some interesting avenues.
                                Musically, I have learned how to play several instruments, including the hammered
                                dulcimer and, of course, the <a href="#">bowed psaltery</a>. God has also blessed me
                                with a few <a href="songs.html">original songs</a>. My interest in archaic weaponry and tools
                                ultimately led me to an interest in bullwhips. Now I build and sell custom
                                <a href="#">bullwhips and snakewhips</a>.</p>
