                        <p>Welcome!<br />
                        We are a group of high school seniors at nex+Gen Academy in Albuquerque, New Mexico. We have been working on a project regarding recycling. Our group specifically addressed the concept of repurposing. As a group, we created a website showing how to reuse common household items that are typically thrown away.<br /><br />
                        <img src="group.JPG" width="512" alt="Photo of the group" /><br /><br />
                        We are doing this project because waste is getting to be a huge part of our daily lives: our waste is harmful to animals, a major source of pollution, is quite simply making our streets look trashy (no pun intended. ☺). You may not see it clearly yet, but it is affecting our environment and if we don't change our ways now it could really harm us in the future. For example, many animals are getting sick because the chemicals in certain products are being discarded improperly rather than being taken to landfills or it’s appropriate location. You may ask yourself, “Why do we produce so much waste as we do if it’s harming our environment?” Good question! The answer is, we are such a spoiled generation and we always want the newest thing. We are constantly out with the old and in with the new. We are going to have to pay for the soon, and we could be ruining the environment for future generations. Taking a step as simple as reusing a household item could make a huge difference. Feel free to explore our website and watch our videos. Thank you all for viewing!</p>
