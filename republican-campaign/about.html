                <h3>Brian Dawson: The President You Can Trust</h3>
                <p>The United States Government has been propped up on a chain of lies and it is failing us. They want us to pay taxes because they tell us they need it for good, yet they continuously misplace funds. The pentagon has misplaced 6.5 trillion dollars and they have no idea where all this money went. They purposed universal healthcare for everyone, yet 27 million people still are not covered, and even though it was suppose to help those in need, it hurt them by making people who just got above the poverty line pay incredibly high out of pocket expenses. We need to rebuild our trust in the government, but to do that we need to elect trustworthy people. That's why Brian Dawson should be the next president. His track record shows time and time again that he is worthy of trust. He has been honest with people in both his private business practice and to the people of Ohio during his time as governor. He would critically review his companies active programs and invited audits. He became like a gardener: he saw what was bearing fruit and what was just a strain on the company's resources and he pruned. We can rise together, but we cannot rise if we do not first trust, and we cannot trust if we have not proved ourselves. Brian Dawson has proved himself during his time as an officer in the military, a business owner, and the governor of Ohio. But now we are asking all Americans to put their trust in Brian Dawson. Let us vote for integrity and not for party. Vote Brian Dawson. Let's put the trust back in government.</p>
