            <p>
                All my songs are a gift from God. My desire is for them to be
                used for His glory. In light of this, you are more than welcome to play my songs for any free or
                not-for-profit event. Examples of free events are church service
                worship or worship gatheries (i.e. a worship night). Events
                that, for the purposes of my songs, are considered
                "not-for-profit" are events that charge customers but the
                charges are to cover the cost of the event or surpluses
                are given to a specific cause. An example of the former is a
                worship night in a rented facility where an entry fee is charged
                to cover the cost of renting the facility. An example of the
                latter is a fundraiser event. <br /><br />
                In all of the above and all following scenarios, I do request
                that you give credit where credit is due. Please credit me
                as the writer of the songs. <br /><br />
                There are a few scenarios where I explicitly request you contact
                me. The first instance is if you would like to use one of my
                songs in an event where you expect to earn a profit. Also, if
                you would like to use my song in a large event (weekly worship
                services at a large church excepted) or would like to do a cover,
                please contact me. In the latter two cases, is very unlikely
                that I will ask for any payment, but I would like to know.<br />
                <br />
                To contact me, send me an email at
                <u>padwolf99@gmail.com</u>.<br />
                Be sure the subject line is relevant, otherwise I may overlook
                your email.
