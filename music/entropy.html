            <h1>A new recording of this song is coming out soon</h1>

            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>This is one of the first songs I wrote, and the first of mine
                I performed live. This song was written during a really
                stressful time in my life. Amongst other things, I was
                not happy how we had been leading our robotics team, and it
                was a week before our second competition. I also had more
                assignments than I had time for. This song was a reflection
                of the chaos I felt, but I knew that I had to keep trusting
                God, because He would work everything out. That week God
                pulled through in some mighty ways. <br />
                Whenever things get hard or stressful, I know I can turn to
                God. He holds everything in His hands, and He will pull me
                through. And even if things don't go as I expect, I can still
                trust in His plan. It's awesome to know that the God of
                the Universe has my back.

            <h1>Lyrics</h1>
            <h3>Verse 1</h3>
            <p>
                My attention a million things demand <br />
                To stay afloat in this chaotic land <br />
                Should I ignore them, they threaten to make <br />
                My weary, weathered spirit break <br />
                But you tell me to worry not <br />
                My well-being is Your ultimate thought <br />
                My success is Your desire <br />
                You want only to lift me higher <br />
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Chorus</h3>
            <p>
                I will trust that Your words are true <br />
                That You're guiding me to make it through <br />
                That You're leading me to a better place <br />
                And you lavish me with unending grace <br />
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Verse 2</h3>
            <p>
                There are things for which I often pray <br />
                But they're unanswered to this day <br />
                I wonder when You'll come through <br />
                Or if You simply will refuse <br />
                But in Your Word You say to wait <br />
                Though it may seem to have doomed fate <br />
                My prayers You'll answer when the time is right <br />
                And You'll come through with Your endless might <br />
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Bridge</h3>
            <p>
                The enemy is pressing me <br />
                I'm crushed under everything <br />
                From the sea save me, I plea <br />
                Before I drown in the Entropy <br />
            </p>

            <h1>Writer Commentary</h1>
            <p>There are some lyrics in the first verse ("My well-being" and
                following lines) that could be misconstrued as Prosperity
                Gospel. These lyrics were written considering spiritual success
                (furthering God's kingdom and spiritual growth), not earthly
                success (wealth, status, happiness, etc.). <br />
