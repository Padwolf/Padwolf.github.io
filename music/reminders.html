            <h2>A new recording of this song was just released!</h2>
            <br />
            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>
                This lyrics to this song were written by my mom as a poem during high school. It is a reflection on God's nature and fingerprints that are evident everywhere in nature. This is the very idea represented by the Greek word λογος (logos). Logos translates roughly to word, reason, or plan. It's where we get the phrase "Word of God". It's the same word John uses in John 1:1: Εν αρχε ην ὁ λογος, In the beginning was The Word. In ancient Greek philosophy it represents the divine reason for the universe evident in creation. <br />
In the opening remarks if his book, John declares that all of creation culminates with Christ and that everything points to Him. <br />
So next time you're outside, look at the trees and remember Ὁ Λογος του Θεου, the Word of God.

            <h1>Lyrics</h1>
            <p>
                In the quiet solitude of the woods<br />
                I sit and look around me<br />
                And absorb the beauty that God took the time<br />
                To presciously and gently combine<br />
                That I may see His love<br />
                Wherever I go<br />
                And worship Him!<br />
                <br />
                I solemnly witness His care<br />
                As He keeps a sparrow in flight<br />
                And guides a leaf gracefully<br />
                To the ground<br />
                I hear His voice in the chirping of the birds<br />
                And I feel His had in the touch of the breeze<br />
                I see the twinkle in His eyes<br />
                As the stars in the heavens<br />
                But most of all, I see His heart<br />
                In the combination of these glorious creations<br />
                That He put in the world<br />
                To remind me of Him
            </p>
