                <p>
                    Maybe it's because I've grown up in a desert, but I have
                    always loved the rain. There is something about the
                    atmosphere around a rain storm that is just... awesome.
                    When I'm in the midst of rain, I'm always reminded of
                    God and of His power. My God is so powerful! He is the
                    God who can call down fire from the heavens and hold apart
                    the waters of a sea. He can raise the dead, and create the
                    entirety of space - every star, every planet, and
                    everything else - in one day! And through His love and by
                    His grace, He chose to use His awesome power to mend the
                    otherwise irreparable chasm between us, so that we may
                    forever have a relationship with Him. <br />
                    Our God is so powerful, indeed infinitely powerful, yet
                    has complete control over His power. When I see the rain,
                    I see an example of the "gentle power" of God. We often
                    take for granted the power in the rain. Water has a lot of
                    destructive potential. Water carves out canyons, rusts
                    metal, and floods towns. But more often than not,
                    especially where I live, the rain isn't a crashing,
                    destructive force, but a gentle, healing force. There is
                    something about the patter of rain and the distant roll of
                    thunder that demonstrates the incredible power of the rain.
                    Yet when I hear it, it doesn't fill me with fear but with
                    peace. That is the power of God. Such tremendous power, and
                    we fully deserve the wrath of God. But we can find rest and
                    peace in His power, knowing that God is a refuge for those
                    who seek Him. <br />
                    I prayed that God would give me a song about rain for months
                    before God gave me this. May you glorify Him because of it.
                    <!-- before God gave me this, and my hope and prayer is that this
                    song leads you to glorify and worship God all the more. -->
                </p>

                    Paints our world with color <br />
                    See the sky <br />
                    No power on earth is greater <br />
                    Than each star in the sky <br />
                    That bathes the world in soft light <br />
                </p>
                <br />

                    And know that our God is nigh <br />
                </p>

                    All power in Your control! <br />
                    You're more than we can fathom <br />
                    Or can e'er completely know <br />
                    By Your holy power <br />
                    You set all things in place <br />
                    But with every passing hour <br />
                    You keep me in your grace <br />
                </p>
