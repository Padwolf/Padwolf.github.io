                  <p>
                      Have you ever stopped to ponder how wonderous the sky is? In
                      a single day, it can take on every color of the rainbow
                      and then some as the clouds sit almost magically on an invisible
                      plane. It's such a complex canvas of beauty, but we rarely
                      stop to admire it. When I think how this incredibly complex
                      entity is but a very tiny fragment of God's creation, I'm
                      bewildered by the depth of His imagination. <br />
                      But of all God's creations, we are His masterpiece. This
                      statement seems to be a paradox; The one part of creation
                      that is inherently flawed because of the corruption of sin
                      is the part that God considers the best. God loves you and
                      me more than He ever loved any other facet of creation. He
                      loves us so much that He gave up heaven, a sacrifice we will
                      never understand in this life, and chose to walk the earth
                      without a home, and ultimately suffer one of the most
                      horrendous deaths that ever occurred. I believe that He
                      would do it all over again even if only one person received
                      the choice of salvation.

                  <h1>Lyrics</h1>
                  <h3>Verse 1</h3>
                  <p>
                      How amazing is the sky! <br />
                      The golden glow at dawn <br />
                      That paints the air with fire <br />
                      The clouds, black in the early morn <br />
                      When the light is barely seeping out <br />
                      But in the middle of the day <br />
                      Fortresses of white <br />
                      Like explosions frozen in time <br />
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <h3>Verse 2</h3>
                  <p>
                      The stars <br />
                      Pins in the jet-black night<br />
                      So powerful in life and death <br />
                      Their reach seems endless <br />
                      To think You created all these stars <br />
                      So much space, with naught but a word <br />
                      And that the power of all stars <br />
                      Ten million times <br />
                      Could never rival Your infinite might <br />
                  </p>
                  <h3>Verse 3</h3>
                  <p>
                      And too think of Your love! <br />
                      That in all of this You value me <br />
                      More than all creation <br />
                      Indeed, You made it all for me <br />
                      And Your life You gave so I'd be free <br />
                      And You'd do it again <br />
                      Bear torture and die <br />
                      If I was the only to be offered life <br />
                  </p>
                  <h3>Ending</h3>
                  <p>
                      How amazing is Your love! <br />
                      Your unmatchable, Your infinite<br />
                      Unending love <br />
                  </p>
                  <br />
